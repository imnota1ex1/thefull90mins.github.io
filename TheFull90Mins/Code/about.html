<h2><u>All About Us!</u></h2>
<p><br>
	<strong><u>Who are we?</u></strong><br><br>
	Here at TheFull90Mins we believe that the full 90 minutes of a game should be available to people. for example if you supported a team and miss out on a derby or <br>one if the biggest games of the season for your team you will most likely want to watch the match, whether it be the full 90 or the highlights. So here at TheFull90Mins,<br> we wan't to offer you the chance to watch the full 90 minutes of a game!<br><br>
	Any questions, you can chat to us on our discord server or you can text on either instagram or twitte, which you can find the links to in the "Links" page!
	<br><br>
	<u>Enjoy!</u>
